## Autocomplete using Foursquare's database of venues

This uses jQuery's autocomplete feature to suggest venues from the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/suggestcompletion), restricted by category (in this case, bars and restaurants) and by geographic area (D.C. metro).

Our solution for [attribution](https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/attribution) was to use the Foursquare logo as the background image in the input fields that use the API.
